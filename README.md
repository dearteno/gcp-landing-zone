# GCP Landing Zone with Terragrunt and OpenTofu - Security Hardened

This project provides a comprehensive, enterprise-ready Google Cloud Platform (GCP) landing zone using Terragrunt and OpenTofu for infrastructure as code. It deploys a complete security-hardened infrastructure including VPC networking, private GKE clusters, load balancers, Gateway API configurations, and comprehensive security controls across multiple environments (dev, staging, production).

> **✅ Latest Update (v2.1.0):** All OpenTofu validation errors have been resolved, Taskfile.yml has replaced Makefile for modern task management, and Google-managed SSL certificates are now used for enhanced security and automation.

# Environment-specific operations
task plan-dev              # Plan dev environment
task apply-dev             # Apply dev environment
task destroy-dev           # Destroy dev environment

task plan-staging          # Plan staging environment
task apply-staging         # Apply staging environment
task destroy-staging       # Destroy staging environment

task plan-prod             # Plan production environment
task apply-prod            # Apply production environment
task destroy-prod          # Destroy production environment

# Batch operations
task plan-all              # Plan all environments

# Utility tasks
task format                # Format all OpenTofu files
task clean                 # Clean temporary files and caches
```

#### **Installation (if not already installed):**

```bash
# macOS
brew install go-task/tap/go-task

# Linux
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b ~/.local/bin

# Windows
choco install go-task
```

### �🔄 **Migration from Terraform**

If you're migrating from Terraform to OpenTofu, use the provided migration script:

```bash
# Run the migration helper script
./migrate-to-opentofu.sh
```

This script will:
- Install OpenTofu on your system
- Verify Terragrunt installation
- Check for existing Terraform state (fully compatible)
- Update Terragrunt configuration for OpenTofu
- Provide step-by-step migration guidance

## 📝 Best Practices

### 🚀 **Deployment Best Practices**
1. **Always run validation first**: `./deploy.sh validate <env>`
2. **Run security checks**: `./deploy.sh security-check <env>`
3. **Plan before apply**: `./deploy.sh deploy <env> plan`
4. **Apply in stages**: First apply non-destructive changes, then update policies
5. **Review changes** in pull requests before merging to main branch
6. **Test in dev/staging** environments before deploying to production
7. **Backup state** before destructive operations: `./deploy.sh backup <env>`

### 🔒 **Security Best Practices**
1. **Use Workload Identity** instead of service account keys in GKE pods
2. **Enable all security features** in production (Binary Authorization, etc.)
3. **Regularly rotate keys** (automated 90-day rotation configured)
4. **Monitor security findings** in Security Command Center
5. **Keep container images updated** and use only signed images in production
6. **Use private clusters** with no public endpoints
7. **Implement network policies** for pod-to-pod communication control

### 🏗️ **Infrastructure Best Practices**
1. **Keep modules version-pinned** for stability and predictable deployments
2. **Use separate state files** for environment and component isolation
3. **Implement proper tagging** for resource management and cost allocation
4. **Configure monitoring and alerting** for all critical components
5. **Use Infrastructure as Code** for all changes (no manual modifications)
6. **Document custom configurations** and maintain architectural decision records

### 🔄 **Operational Best Practices**
1. **Regular backup verification** to ensure restore capability
2. **Monitor drift detection** and remediate configuration drift promptly
3. **Implement change management** processes for production deployments
4. **Maintain disaster recovery** procedures and test them regularly
5. **Use blue-green deployments** for zero-downtime updates
6. **Implement proper logging** and log retention policies

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### 🔧 **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### 1. **GCS Bucket Issues**
```bash
# Create state bucket if it doesn't exist
gsutil mb gs://your-terraform-state-bucket

# Enable versioning for state backup
gsutil versioning set on gs://your-terraform-state-bucket
```

#### 2. **Permission Issues**
```bash
# Check current permissions
gcloud projects get-iam-policy YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Add required roles to service account
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:your-sa@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/container.admin"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:your-sa@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/compute.admin"
```

#### 3. **API Activation Issues**
```bash
# Enable all required APIs (done automatically by deploy script)
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable cloudkms.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable securitycenter.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable logging.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com
```

#### 4. **OpenTofu Installation Issues**
```bash
# Install OpenTofu on macOS
brew install opentofu

# Install OpenTofu on Linux
curl -fsSL https://get.opentofu.org/install-opentofu.sh | sh

# Install on Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install opentofu

# Verify installation
tofu version
```

#### 5. **Terragrunt Configuration Issues**
```bash
# Ensure Terragrunt uses OpenTofu
export TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH=tofu

# Or set permanently in your shell profile
echo 'export TERRAGRUNT_TFPATH=tofu' >> ~/.zshrc

# Verify configuration
terragrunt --version
```

#### 6. **State Locking Issues**
```bash
# Force unlock if state is stuck (use with caution)
cd environments/dev/networking
terragrunt force-unlock LOCK_ID

# Clean up cache if experiencing issues
./deploy.sh cleanup dev
```

#### 7. **Security Validation Failures**
```bash
# Run security check to identify issues
./deploy.sh security-check dev

# Validate configuration syntax
./deploy.sh validate dev

# Check organization policies
gcloud resource-manager org-policies list --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

### 🆘 **Getting Help**
